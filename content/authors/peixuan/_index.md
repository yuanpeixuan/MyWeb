Welcome to my website. I am a PhD candidate in Finance at Rutgers Business School, Rutgers University. My research agenda broadly falls within the field of asset pricing. My primary research focuses on derivatives pricing, market anomalies and machine learning. I am on the job market and will be available for interviews during the 2020-2021 academic year.
