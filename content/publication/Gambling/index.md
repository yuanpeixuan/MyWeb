abstract: We discover that investors' preferences for gambling mainly involve stocks that have performed poorly in the past three months, as lottery-like stocks with poor performance are much more likely to generate large payoffs than those with good performance (61.53% vs. 40.17%). Furthermore, lotto investors tend to believe that lottery-like stocks with poor performance may have a vigorous rebound shortly, while those with good performance may be less likely to produce a positive return given their high prices. Therefore, lottery-like stocks with poor performance have a highly effective lottery-like look, and thus they attract lotto investors. On the other hand, loser stocks without lottery-like features may continue to perform poorly. Overly optimistic (pessimistic) beliefs about stocks with (without) lottery-like features result in a pronounced lottery premium among loser stocks.
