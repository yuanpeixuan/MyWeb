abstract: We propose a method to estimate relatively high frequent market left- and right-tail risks by constructing trading strategies with daily S&P 500 options. Our measures are forward-looking and show low correlations with other risk factors. We dissect pricing implications of tail risks for cross-sectional stock returns. Stocks more sensitive to left-tail (right-tail) risk exhibit lower (higher) returns. The right-tail risk premium is significant and partially absorbs the left-tail premium. Results also hold using equity portfolios and mutual funds as test assets. The widespread effect of right-tail risk on assets stands in contrast to previous findings that only negative jumps are priced.
